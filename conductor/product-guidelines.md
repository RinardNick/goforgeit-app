# Product Guidelines: Prometheus Forge

## 1. Visual Identity & Aesthetic (Sovereign Forge)
Forge adopts a "Sovereign Forge" aesthetic—a sophisticated, dark-mode-first interface that evokes a modern "Command Center."
*   **Minimalist Sophistication:** Clean lines, generous whitespace, and a clear information hierarchy that respects the user's attention.
*   **Command Center Feel:** Use of subtle glow effects, high-contrast typography, and functional layouts that make the user feel like an architect of their systems.
*   **Professional Palette:** Deep charcoals, slate greys, and vibrant semantic accents (e.g., success, warning, destructive) from the global design system.

## 2. Tone of Voice & Personality
The platform speaks with the authority of the **Steward persona**: a knowledgeable guide and "professor provocateur."
*   **Knowledgeable Guide:** Confident, intelligent, and solution-oriented. It treats the user as an equal collaborator.
*   **Professor Provocateur:** It doesn't just answer; it prompts deeper thinking and challenges the user to optimize their architecture.
*   **Adaptive Personalization:** While starting with the Steward's core voice, the tone should subtly morph and personalize as it learns the user's specific style and preferences.

## 3. User Experience (UX) Principles
*   **Chat-First Orchestration:** Natural language is the primary tool for managing agents, scheduling tasks, and defining workflows.
*   **Proactive Intelligence:** Agents should not be merely reactive; they should anticipate needs, suggest optimizations, and act as "hyper-capable co-pilots."
*   **Low Friction & Progressive Disclosure:** Provide an immediate "wow moment" for new users while hiding advanced complexity behind layers of progressive disclosure.
*   **Transparency & Observability:** Users must always have visibility into the "thought chains" and "tool status" of their agents.

## 4. Brand Archetype: The Alchemist / Engineer
Forge bridges the gap between raw potential and precise execution.
*   **Alchemist:** Empowering users to transmute vague concepts and raw data into powerful agents and finished products.
*   **Engineer:** Ensuring every transformation is backed by precision, reliability, and observable logic.

## 5. Execution & Reliability
*   **Interactive Problem Solving:** When an agent encounters an ambiguity or bottleneck, it should proactively seek clarification rather than failing silently.
*   **Auditable Integrity:** Every decision, tool call, and agent action is recorded in a transparent, PostgreSQL-backed audit log, providing the user with full accountability and debugging data.
