# Product Guide: Prometheus Forge

## Initial Concept
To transform the existing admin tool into a multi-tenant, API-first Universal Agent Platform (Forge) powered by Google ADK v1.21+ and exposed via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## 1. Executive Summary
**Prometheus Forge** is the "Central Agent Operating System" for the ambitious professional. It resolves the "agency crisis"—the paradox of having unprecedented ambition but being bottlenecked by fragmented tools and time scarcity—by enabling users to orchestrate teams of specialized AI agents. Forge is not just a productivity tool; it is a force multiplier that allows individuals to operate with the capacity of an enterprise.

## 2. Target Audience (ICP)
**Primary Persona:** "The Ambitious Optimizer" (Alex Chen)
*   **Demographics:** 25-40 years old, tech-savvy professionals, product managers, entrepreneurs, and indie hackers.
*   **Psychographics:** Driven "CEOs of their own lives" who value efficiency, autonomy, and leverage. They are early adopters seeking a competitive edge.
*   **Pain Points:** Information overload, tool fragmentation, time scarcity, and execution barriers due to specialized skill gaps.
*   **Goals:** To multiply their output (10x leverage), build and launch ideas rapidly, and maintain architectural control over their digital operations.

**Secondary Persona:** "The Overwhelmed Professional"
*   **Profile:** 35-55 years old (doctors, lawyers, small business owners) seeking relief from complexity and reliable outcomes rather than cutting-edge tech features.

## 3. Core Value Proposition
Forge transforms the user from an overwhelmed individual contributor into a **Commanding Orchestrator**.
*   **Leverage:** Multiply personal effort by delegating complex, recurring, or specialized tasks to autonomous agents.
*   **Unification:** A single "Command Center" to synthesize data and control operations, replacing dozens of fragmented apps.
*   **Action:** Move beyond passive information gathering to active execution—building apps, launching campaigns, and automating workflows.
*   **Accessibility:** Expose powerful AI capabilities through a natural, conversational interface as well as robust developer APIs.

## 4. Key Features & Capabilities
*   **Conversational Agent Management:** A natural language chat interface to hire, schedule, and direct a team of agents.
*   **Universal Agent Registry (API/MCP):** A centralized hub to manage agents that can be deployed anywhere—exposed via API for developers or via MCP for integration with IDEs (Cursor) and other AI clients (Claude Desktop).
*   **Agent Builder & "Forge":** specialized meta-agents that assist in creating and refining new tools and agents on demand.
*   **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Secure `Organization > Project > Agent` hierarchy supporting both personal productivity and enterprise team deployment.
*   **Enterprise Integration:** Capabilities to embed agents into existing business systems or user products.

## 5. Strategic Vision
Forge aims to be the **Operating System for the Agentic Future**. It bridges the gap between personal productivity and enterprise-grade deployment, treating AI Agents as first-class citizens that are composable, persistent, and universally accessible. The platform embodies the **Alchemist/Engineer** archetype: transforming raw potential into tangible reality with precision and reliability.
